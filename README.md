Given an array of time intervals for people entering and leaving
a room consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei).
What is the maximum number of people in the room simultaneously?

Examples:

Input: [[2, 10], [3, 4], [6, 9]]
Output: 2

Input: [[1, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [5, 6]]
Output: 4

Input: [[1, 8], [2, 7], [3, 5], [5, 7], [6, 7], [6, 8], [7, 8]]
Output: 5

Input: [[1, 3], [4, 7], [10, 11], [2, 4], [10, 12], [4, 6], [10, 13], [1, 4], [9, 12], [2, 5], [9, 11], [4, 6], [8, 11], [5, 7]]
Output: 6
